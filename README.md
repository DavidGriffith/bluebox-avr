**Bluebox AVR**
===============

---

***Bluebox AVR*** implements a bluebox (see 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box) on AVR microcontrollers.  This 
project is roughly a translation of the PIC-based bluebox at 
http://projectmf.org/bluebox.html.  Schematics and board layouts will 
soon be available in different repositories.
